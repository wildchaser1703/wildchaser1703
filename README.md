# About Me

ðŸ”­ I'm deeply passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI system design â€” especially in areas that blend structured business impact with advanced models like XGBoost, NLP, and Time Series Forecasting. I am constantly refining my skills across core CS, ML algorithms, and systems thinking.

ðŸ’­ My mission is to build intelligent systems that simplify decision-making at scale, whether it's through forecasting, personalization, or large language models. I aim to solve real-world problems that matter.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always up for collaborating on ML projects, mentoring newcomers in tech, or contributing to open-source data/ML tooling. If you're working on something cool, let's connect!

# Bio

ðŸ§  I'm currently working as a Data Scientist and foraying into MLOps. My recent work includes time series forecasting, interpretable XGBoost pipelines, and NLP-based analytics for strategic decision-making.

âŒ› I come from an Electrical Engineering background and pivoted into Data Science. Over the last 2 years, Iâ€™ve worked on problems at the intersection of business intelligence, predictive modeling, and customer behavior.

ðŸ“š I'm a continuous learner â€” currently focused on mastering key ML topics through books like *Practical Machine Learning (Oâ€™Reilly)*, projects, and courses on Coursera and Stanford Online.

ðŸŽ¨ Outside of tech, I am a creative at heart! I enjoy painting and photography.
